[A. At the moment, loading a new land is destructive.
	This is fine as long as you don't want to return to
	a land after leaving it.
	
 B. Create a way to return to previous lands.
	For now, do this by creating
	a simple save + load machine for DreamLands.
	You can already start them in any room.
	Create the possibility for starting the player
	at any position & with any params...
	It won't be easy, probably scratch NavdiSolePlayer entirely.]

The current paradigm that navdi is using for moving between rooms
doesn't quite cut it for the structure I have in mind...

I need to take it one step at a time. hmm.

OK, first of all I'm splitting things up into two "lands."
This won't quite cut it, so I also need to handle NavdiSolePlayer
differently...

Rather than the way I've been handling it,
	*each land has an assigned player.*

You have to be able to return to a land...
