[ A. player makes careful decisions when climbing a tower

  B. world contains ten 'fragile' towers. treated as disposable;
	 if player fails, they easily move on to the next tower.
	 simple victory: clear any tower. deeper victory: clear all. ]

problem - it's not interesting
-> add numbers? that's the language i've used often lately
-> rather than add numbers, unique glyphs?
(!) initial idea was to allow the player to move forward to a new tower
like inconsiderate climbers https://droqen.itch.io/inconsiderate-climbers
-> tower state must be fragile, you can destroy a tower and want to skip
-> there are ten fragile towers, you can complete all of them
-> completing any one tower awards the player a "win"
-> bonus completionist score is doing all ten w/o breaking them
-> ten unique levels...
-> presented to the player as if they are proc gen, *disposable*

problem - how to make the levels fragile?
-> well that's easy. you can break blocks, including those req'd to ascend.

(!) upon reaching rightmost (11th) screen (which is strictly optional)
a player with 0 score is told that they should go back and try again
or maybe refresh the page, because they failed at all ten towers.
