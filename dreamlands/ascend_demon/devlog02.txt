ok, did i even succeed at what i wanted to do?

from 01:
[ A. player makes careful decisions when climbing a tower

  B. world contains ten 'fragile' towers. treated as disposable;
	 if player fails, they easily move on to the next tower.
	 simple victory: clear any tower. deeper victory: clear all. ]

... currently there are no careful decisions to be made...
it's absolutely trivial to climb a tower. there are no critical blocks
that you don't want to destroy. the lightning bolt effect is COOL
but it really is not necessary to use it, at all! hmm...
i'll try making a level that's hard to climb. level design!

UPDATE: i made the walljump (significantly) worse for climbing.
now i can make a tower that's impossible to climb -- which is good!
