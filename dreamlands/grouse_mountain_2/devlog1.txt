devlog 1 for "grouse mountain 2"
- right. why am i doing this again??
- extreme sports, grouse mountain, ski hill, a ski hill in summer
- but now the player is a bird (a grouse)
- why lol

i think i've lost the plot, and that's ok.
[AB] - was there ever a purpose to putting all this together?
could i find one or should i just start over?
i wanted to write a nice message about passing through a ski hill
in the off season . . . but is that a game? do i need to make that
a game?

after some brief reflection, no, i do not think i do.

return to the abstract drawing board. chill out.
make something that makes sense.
